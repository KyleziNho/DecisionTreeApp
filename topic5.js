        answer: 0,

        answer: 2,
        explanation: "The question about university populations is least likely to induce bias as it's about general statistics rather than specific to Mr. Jones, avoiding conjunction fallacy and representativeness biases that affect the other questions."

        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Simon's bounded rationality refers to the limited cognitive capabilities of decision makers that prevent them from making perfectly rational decisions, not a complete inability to handle constraints or consider risks."

            "Satisficing"
        ],
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "This is an example of the availability heuristic - plane crashes are more memorable and widely reported in media, making them more 'available' in people's minds and thus perceived as more likely than everyday risks like hot tap water."

            "John likes gardening"
        ],
        answer: 3,
        explanation: "This demonstrates the conjunction fallacy - a simple statement is always more probable than that same statement plus additional conditions, regardless of how plausible those conditions may seem."

        ],
        answer: 2,
        explanation: "This is a classic example of anchoring and adjustment, where different initial values (age 9 vs. 140) led participants to adjust from these different anchor points, resulting in significantly different final estimates."

        ],
        answer: 2,
        explanation: "While illusory correlation relates to perceiving relationships where none exist and can arise from availability bias and explain superstitious beliefs, it does not explain overconfidence bias, which is a separate psychological phenomenon."

        answer: 0,
        explanation: "This demonstrates ease of recall (availability heuristic), where a dramatic, memorable event made doctors overestimate the risk and change their prescribing behavior based on this easily recalled incident."

        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "With parallel systems (where any single failure causes system failure), people tend to overestimate the probability of overall failure, as opposed to series systems where people underestimate conjunctive probabilities."

The lecturer is interested in the total time it will take to prepare and mark the assessment. The multiple choice test will take 20 hours to prepare and 1 hour to mark. The exam will take 2 hours to prepare. However sometimes students come up with varied correct responses to essay questions and it is difficult to predict this beforehand.
